## Objectives

- create lists to hold varying data 
- use for loops to run code a specified number of times
- use for in loops to loop through a list to its end
- use conditionals to control the flow of your code
- use functions to organize your code into easily readable and recognizable parts.

## Lecture


## Lists
- Lists are arrays 
- accessing data in an array -> array[index]
- the built in slice syntax -> Possibly the best thing about python

## Blackjack!!!
- using a for loop in python
- looping through a list
- random.shuffle(list)
- while loops for running code continuously
- conditionals for deciding when to break a loop 
- functions to organize your code
- when to use arguments -> especially important in python
