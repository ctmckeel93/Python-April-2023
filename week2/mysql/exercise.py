# Worldy wacky shop of wonders!!!!

# Together as a group, come up with an idea for a shop that sells anything you want. 
# Think about what a shop might have as attributes, maybe a name, address, list of items etc
# Associate that Shop with another class called Inventory 
# Give the inventory a name and a price.

# Create the items first and then create the Shop and add the items to the shops inventory
# Make a method to loop through the inventory and display the info of each item - think about how you can simplify that code in the class

# Bonus: create a staticmethod to check and make sure in the Item class: the name is not an empty string and the price is greater than 0
# Bonus: Validate the values before creating the Item and print "Not valid" if it fails
# Bonus: Add some more methods together and embrace your creativity!
